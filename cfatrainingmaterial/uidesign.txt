# AnalystTrainer Landing Page: Full SEO & AI‑Optimized Spec

This spec is designed for direct use with Claude/code to refactor analysttrainer.com into:
- A high‑converting funnel.[page:1]
- SEO‑optimized for finance certification terms.[web:16]
- AI‑friendly (clear structure, semantic HTML, JSON‑LD, FAQ, and analytics hooks).[web:16]
- Visually closer to Perplexity (clean center column, minimal chrome, calm UI).[web:11][web:18]

---

## 1. Core Strategy & Information Architecture

### 1.1 Primary goals

- **Primary conversion**: Start Free Trial (email + password; no card, or clearly stated if required).[page:1]
- Secondary conversions:
  - Download sample questions (lead magnet).[page:1]
  - Join email list (study tips sequence).[page:1]
  - View demo (video or interactive walkthrough).[page:1][web:19]

### 1.2 Primary positioning & keyword focus

- Main positioning: “Finance certification exam prep platform” with a focus on CFA and FRM.[page:1]
- Core SEO target (home): `finance certification exam prep` / `CFA Level 1 question bank` with long‑tail variants in sub‑sections.[web:16]

### 1.3 Page‑level information architecture

Use a single long‑form landing page with the following semantic structure:

- `<header>`: Logo, primary navigation, main CTA.[page:1]
- `<main>`:
  - `<section id="hero">` – core value prop, main CTA, above the fold.[page:1]
  - `<section id="pain">` – cost of failing.[page:1]
  - `<section id="product">` – features and product UI.[page:1]
  - `<section id="proof">` – metrics and testimonials.[page:1]
  - `<section id="pricing">` – plans and guarantee.[page:1]
  - `<section id="faq">` – FAQs with FAQPage schema.[web:16]
  - `<section id="final-cta">` – final push.[web:19]
- `<footer>`: Resource links, legal, company info.[page:1]

Ensure headings follow a single H1, then H2/H3 hierarchy to keep both SEO and AI parsers clean.[web:16]

### 2.3 Hero section (H1 + CTA + proof)

Semantic structure:

<section id="hero"> <h1>Pass Your Finance Certification Exams on Your First Try</h1> <p>Master CFA, FRM, and more with an exam-style question bank, realistic mock exams, and analytics that pinpoint your weakest topics.</p> <div class="hero-ctas"> <button>Start Free Trial</button> <button>View Question Bank Demo</button> <p>No credit card required.

Design:

Two‑column layout on desktop:

Left: copy, CTAs, proof row.[page:1]

Right: product screenshot card (Perplexity‑style surface).[web:11]

CTA priority:

Primary button: filled, --primary, text “Start Free Trial”.[page:1]

Secondary: outline button, label “View Question Bank Demo”.[page:1]

Above‑the‑fold content must keep LCP small: keep screenshot optimized and lazy‑load anything below the fold.[web:16]

2.4 Pain / Cost of failing
Purpose: sharpen motivation for CFA/FRM candidates.[page:1]

Structure (3 cards within <section id="pain">):

Cards:

Card 1 – “£50,000+ Lost Earnings”

A large central card resembling a Perplexity conversation panel:

Top bar with “Question Bank” tabs (e.g., “CFA L1”, “FRM Part I”).[web:11]

Left column list of questions with tags (topic, difficulty).[page:1]

Right panel showing analytics chart.[page:1]

This can be a static image initially, but layout should feel like a functional app.[web:11][web:18]

2.6 Social proof & metrics strip
Full‑width strip <section id="proof"> just below product section.[page:1]

Light contrasting background; 4 metrics:

92% – “Pass rate among engaged users”.[page:1]

Short quote (2–3 lines).[page:1]

5‑star rating row (icons).[web:19]

Optionally add a simple “logo row” for firms (if allowed / anonymized) like “AnalystTrainer students work at: [logo badges]”.[web:19]

2.8 Pricing & guarantee
Section <section id="pricing"> with H2: “Choose Your Study Plan”.[page:1]

2.10 Final CTA + micro‑conversion
Final section <section id="final-cta"> with:

H2: “Join 3,000+ Finance Professionals Who Passed”.[page:1]

Short line: “Start your free trial in under a minute. No credit card required.”[web:19]

3. SEO Implementation (On‑Page, Technical & Schema)
3.1 Head tags & meta
In the <head>:

<title>:

“Finance Certification Exam Prep | CFA & FRM Question Bank | AnalystTrainer” (or similar, <= 60 chars).[web:16]

<meta name="description">:

Include main value prop, certifications, and benefit in 140–160 chars.[web:16]

Open Graph:

og:title, og:description, og:type=website, og:url, og:image (optimized screenshot).[web:16]

Twitter card: summary_large_image.[web:16]

3.2 Semantic HTML & headings
Single H1 in hero; H2 for each major section; H3 for cards if needed.[web:16]

Use <nav>, <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, <button>, <form>, <input>, <label> properly for AI parsing and accessibility.[web:16]

3.3 Internal linking & keyword placement
Ensure nav items and in‑content links use meaningful anchor text like “CFA Level 1 question bank” and “FRM mock exams”.[web:16]

Place main keyword (finance certification prep / CFA question bank) in:

H1.

First paragraph.

At least one H2.

Button alt text or aria‑labels where relevant.[web:16]

Add at least 2–3 internal links to sub‑pages (e.g., dedicated CFA page, blog posts about exam strategy).[web:16]

3.4 Image optimization
Use next‑gen formats (WebP/AVIF) for hero screenshot and logos.[web:16]

width and height defined; loading="lazy" for below‑the‑fold images.[web:16]

alt text descriptive and keyword aware but natural (e.g., “CFA Level 1 question bank dashboard showing performance analytics”).[web:16]

3.5 Structured data (JSON‑LD)
Add JSON‑LD block in <head> (or template) combining Product, Offer, AggregateRating, and FAQPage. Adjust values to your actual numbers:

text
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "AnalystTrainer Finance Certification Exam Prep",
  "description": "Online platform with CFA and FRM exam-style question banks, mock exams, and performance analytics.",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "AnalystTrainer"
  },
  "url": "https://www.analysttrainer.com/",
  "image": "https://www.analysttrainer.com/og-image.jpg",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "reviewCount": "250"
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "AggregateOffer",
    "priceCurrency": "GBP",
    "lowPrice": "0",
    "highPrice": "999",
    "offerCount": "4",
    "offers": [
      {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "name": "Free Trial",
        "price": "0",
        "priceCurrency": "GBP",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
      },
      {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "name": "Basic Plan",
        "price": "299",
        "priceCurrency": "GBP",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
      },
      {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "name": "Standard Plan",
        "price": "599",
        "priceCurrency": "GBP",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</script>
Add FAQPage schema:

text
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How similar are your questions to the real CFA and FRM exams?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our question bank is written to mirror real CFA and FRM exam blueprints, difficulty levels, and wording. Each item includes step-by-step explanations and formula references."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What happens if I fail my exam after using AnalystTrainer?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If you complete the required percentage of questions and mock exams and still do not pass, you may qualify for an extended access period or a refund under our pass guarantee policy."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
These help generate rich snippets for product, pricing, rating, and FAQs.[web:16]

4. AI‑Ops & Analytics Instrumentation
4.1 Event tracking model
Define a small event spec for funnel analysis and AI‑ops:

view_page – page load with referrer and UTM parameters.[web:19]

view_section – when sections come into viewport (hero, product, pricing, faq).[web:19]

click_cta – start_trial, view_demo, pricing_plan_select, faq_open.[web:19]

start_signup – begin sign‑up form.[web:19]

complete_signup – successful trial creation (with plan).[web:19]

error_signup – validation or server error.[web:19]

Use a single track(eventName, payload) wrapper so you can plug into GA4, Segment, or your own endpoint.[web:19]

4.2 Conversion funnel labeling
Attach data-event and data-section attributes to key elements:

text
<button
  data-event="click_cta"
  data-cta="start_trial"
  data-section="hero"
>
  Start Free Trial
</button>
For A/B tests (headlines, CTAs), include data-variant="A"/"B" on variants; log with experiment_id so AI‑ops tooling can optimize copy over time.[web:19]

4.3 AI‑readable copy structure
Ensure each section has a concise intro paragraph and a bullet list; this makes it easier for AI agents to summarize and repurpose content (e.g., for chatbots or support).[web:19]

Keep benefits phrased in outcomes (“pass on the first try”, “cut 50% of wasted study time”) so AI can use them in responses without re‑engineering your copy.[web:19]

5. Perplexity‑Style UI Notes (Styling & Micro‑Interactions)
5.1 Component styling guidelines
Buttons:

Primary: pill or rounded (border-radius: 9999px or equivalent).[web:11]

Shadow: subtle (e.g., 0 10px 25px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.25) for dark).[web:11]

Hover: darken background, slightly increase shadow and scale to 1.02.[web:11]

Cards:

Uniform padding (20–24px).[web:11]

Very light border and background contrast; minimal shadows, mostly on hover.[web:11]

Avoid strong gradients; keep colors flat and calm.[web:11]

Inputs/forms:

Use minimalist input styling similar to Perplexity’s prompt bar: rounded, filled, subtle focus ring.[web:11]

Single email field for early funnel to reduce friction; password later or in the same step with clear guidance.[web:19]

5.2 Motion & transitions
Use transition: all 150ms ease-out; on buttons and cards.[web:11]

For section in‑view animations, keep them subtle (fade + small upward motion) and ensure they don’t hurt CLS or performance.[web:16]

5.3 Accessibility
Color contrast: ensure text vs background passes WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body text).[web:16]

Focus states: custom outlines for keyboard navigation (visible, not removed).[web:16]

ARIA:

aria-expanded & aria-controls for FAQ accordions.[web:16]

Proper aria-label for icon‑only buttons (e.g., mobile menu).[web:16]

6. Implementation Checklist for Claude
Use this checklist as direct instructions:

Refactor layout into the sections described above, using semantic HTML tags and a centered column.[page:1]

Implement a simple design system (tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and radii) matching the Perplexity‑like aesthetic.[web:11]

Rebuild hero, product, proof, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, and final CTA sections with responsive CSS or Tailwind.[page:1][web:19]

Add SEO meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and structured data (Product, Offer, AggregateRating, FAQPage).[web:16]

Optimize images (WebP, dimensions, lazy loading) and ensure good Core Web Vitals by limiting heavy scripts.[web:16]

Implement tracking attributes and a track(eventName, payload) helper for analytics and AI‑ops driven optimization.[web:19]
