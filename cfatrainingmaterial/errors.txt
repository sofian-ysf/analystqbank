RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. CRITICAL (Immediate Action Required):
   - Implement /terms page for Terms of Service
     * Required for legal compliance
     * Needed for signup/account creation flow
     * Currently blocks user signup experience
   
   - Implement /forgot-password page for password recovery
     * Essential for user account recovery
     * Impacts authentication flow

2. HIGH PRIORITY:
   - Implement /refund page for Refund Policy
     * Important for customer trust and legal compliance
     * Users cannot find refund information
   
3. MEDIUM PRIORITY:
   - Implement /blog page or remove blog links
     * Currently advertised but broken
     * Could improve engagement if implemented
   
   - Implement /disclaimer page or remove link
     * Legal compliance item
     * Currently unavailable


TESTING NOTES
=============
- All links tested via direct navigation
- Authentication-required pages correctly redirect to login
- No broken images or assets detected
- Page load times appear normal
- Navigation consistency issues noted between different page templates
  (Landing page has different nav structure than inner pages)


CONCLUSION
==========

relate to missing legal/policy pages which are important for compliance. The user
authentication flow is blocked by the missing /terms page and /forgot-password page.

Priority Order for Fixes:
